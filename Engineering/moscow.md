# MoSCoW principle

## Must have

Non-negotiable features => release is useless without them.

## Should have

Features one step below Must-haves. They are essential for the prodcut but without them, it will still work. 

## Could have

Nice-to-haves, features not necessary to the core function of the product. These features are usually first to de-prioritize.

## Won't have (this time)

This category is to manage stakeholder's expectations about what will not be included in a given release.
