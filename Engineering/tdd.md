# Test Driven Development


Work in cycles:

1. Implement test
2. Implement minimum code required to pass the test
3. Refactor

This mentod ensures proper coverage of the code and usually results in clean code.
But it requires much more discipline -> no much of developers actually follow pure TDD...
