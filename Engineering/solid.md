# S.O.L.I.D.

## Single responsibility

Class should do only one thing (and do it right). Class should be designed in a way that there could be only one reason to change the class. Also aplicable to methods.

## Open/closed 

Open for extension but closed for modifications. In other words, if someone needs to customize the behaviour they should do it by extending the class, not to change existing code. 

## Liskov substitution

Fuctions that use reference type should also work (without any modifications) on their sub-types.

## Interface segregation

Code should not depend on methods it does not use -> "large" interfaces should be split into small, specific interfaces. 

## Dependency inversion

High-level modules should not importlow-level modules, they should only depend on abstractions. 

# Clean code

Uncle Bob preaches that clean code when there is high cohesion and low coupling.
